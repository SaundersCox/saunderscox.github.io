		  <h2>About</h2>
		  <p>I'm currently a transfer student with junior standing in Computer Science at Virginia Tech. I live north of campus right off Patrick Henry. It's a perfect location, just a minute from the highway, a few minutes from Blacksburg Skatepark, and about the average fifteen-minute bus commute to campus.</p>
		  <p>I have a close friend group at Tech that's helped me continue to look forward through all the challenges thrown at CS students. One of my friends is from Thailand, and the other two are from Korea, so I've been lucky to experience even more selection than the already great food service VT provides.</p>
          <p> I've always loved integrating my life with technology. Whether it be video games, music production, worldwide communications, planning trips, or maintaining a diet, I've always had computers to assist me. From my elementary school years, I was first introduced to HTML and CSS through my kind of social media: forums, Neopets, and Gaia Online. In my neopets shop, I'd embed a MIDI file of some catchy anime intro I'd never seen. I never intended to make a profit with my shop, but I just liked the user experience of having visitors enter a virtual shop with intense music.</p>
		  <p>Fast forward to today, I've developed many Java projects for various emulated scenarios. Most of these scenarios were prompted from college courses, but they've given me some insight on the applications I have the potential to build. And better yet, I can envision how I may contribute in a team environment. I love expressing my creative side when applicable, and I prefer to approach solutions with an open mind.</p>
		  <p>Additionally, I've become familiar with some of the quirkiness of C and the streamlined nature of Python. My Fall 2019 courses consist of CS 3114: Data Structures and Algorithms--mostly partnered projects in Java, CS 2506: Intro to Computer Organization (Part 2)--C labs and circuitry studies, CS 3654: Data Analytics and Visualization--Pandas in Python and manipulating datasets.
